"""
Test cases for gRPC-based agent communication including DM and channel reply features.

This module contains integration tests that verify:
1. Direct messaging between WorkerAgent instances
2. Channel messaging in general channel  
3. Channel reply functionality using on_channel_reply interface

The tests use the workspace_test.yaml configuration to create a realistic 
network environment with gRPC transport and thread messaging.
