"""
Shared workspace prompt builder for all adapters.

Generates system prompt sections that teach agents about:
- Their identity and workspace context
- Multi-agent collaboration (@mention delegation)
- Workspace REST API skills (files, browser, tunnels)

Claude gets these as context alongside MCP tools.
Non-MCP agents (OpenClaw, Codex) get these as actionable API
instructions they can call via curl/requests/fetch.
